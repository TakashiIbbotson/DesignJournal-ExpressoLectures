=========================================

<center>Week One
----------------------------------------
####<center><i>The Continuum.</center>

The <i>Art/Design Continuum</i> is very dynamic and ever-changing.  Most artists do not hold a static place on this scale as they are constantly moving back and forth along it.  Although artists and designers would like to believe they are different there are distinct crossovers between the two professions.  An artist can design and a design can make art.


<i>Damien Hirst</i> is an English artist known for his Conceptual art, Installation art and paintings however Damien has been known for his diversity as he moves along the continuum.  His art is known to revolve around death and has received a lot of controversial views for the harshness of these pieces.  For example his series of dead animals show the animals sliced into pieces and stored inside airtight cases. For this reason they are preserved and the audience to these pieces can see inside of them.

 Another piece of his with a large critical response was His 'In and Out of Love' featuring dead butterflies in a large room. Critics complained that he killed over 9000 butterflies in order to create this gallery.  This piece in particular shows his lack of stasis on the continuum as not only does this gallery show his artistic skills but also shows his skills as a designer.

<i>Detier Rams</i> is a German industrial designer who is best known for his design impace within the electronics company 'Braun'.  Rams designed products for the company such as Reel to Reel Tape Records, Record Players and much more.  His designs could be looked at as art as they almost represent minimalistic structures.  This follows his hypothesis that a simplistic approach creates a timeless design.

The role of the designer is changing.  There are a variety of ways in which a person can design.  They could design a concept/idea, an object, an experience, a product, a process and more.

An example of a concept is Twitter; Twitter is simply an idea that was designed and built.
An example of an experience is '24 Hours of Happy' in which Pharrell William's song Happy' is on a loop for 24 hours.

Experience is very important.  Companies such as Apple have made sure that the customer's experience is valued.  Their patented glass staircase is aesthetically beautiful and creates a better experience for the customer heightening the chances of them purchasing an Apple product.

The Barcelona Pavillion was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the 1920's.  Alhough Mies was an architectial designer he also designing the interior furniture after being unable to locate any furniture he liked for the exhibition building.

Daniel Eatock also refused to stick to a static position on the continuum.  He was a trained Graphic Designer who designed the iconic Big Brother logo.  This logo has adapted so much over the years however it is still recognisable to the public.

Eatock takes conventionally irritating things and turns them into art.  Examples of this include dancing to car alarms and photographing items that wouldn't usually be seen as art.

Eatock also created a Bic pen lid made of gold.  he said it 'transforms the pen into a hybrid carrier of value.'  This shows his ability to shift between product and graphic design.

Tord Boontje created a product that was adaptable by the customer.  His flower based branch lamp shade can be twisted so that the user can fit it specifically to their light bulb.

<center>Week Two
-------------------------------------------
####<center><i>You are a channel...</center>

First of all words matter.  Grammar and spelling must be perfect.  Business plans are incredibly important and should have a narrative arc and a logical order.

The parable of the squirrel and the cow.
The squirrel hides his nuts away and struggles to find them again.  The squirrel does not put these nuts to good use.
  <br>
  <br>

  <center><img src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs51/f/2009/322/6/0/Lost_Nuts_by_SpectralPresence.png" style="width:304px;heightpx"style="width:304px;height:px"></center>></center>></center>
  <br>
  <br>
    The cow however eats grass and then digests it multiple times through 4 stomachs.  This helps the cow lactate and in the end we receive milk.  This means through multiple 'drafts' the cow gave us something valuable.

The content mix.
You are a curator of choice and you get to exercise a degree of choice.  Quirky brand images are good as they will make you recognisable and make you stand out from the crowd however  it is not good to focus too much on the quirk as that will take away from your overall ideal.  You are a broadcast and people will watch you.

Parallel processing is the process of taking two completely different things and creating something new out of them.

Broadcast programming Scheuduling is the practice of organising TV or radio programsin a daily, weekly or seasonlong schedule.  These strategies are employedto give programmes the best possible chance of attracting and retaining an audience.  A variety of shows will generally keep the audience entertained. A consistent speed/length of a show will become tiresome soa variety of program lengths should be collaborated to create the daytime TV.  Every channel has a different personality and these personalities should be consistent and sustainable.

Channels can take many different forms on the Internet.  Pinterest, Github, Dribbbler, Twitter, Wordpress and DeviantArt are all examples of this.

Last but not least you will get the same effort back from others as you put in.
